# Summary Report: “AI/ML/GenAI on AWS Workshop”

### Event Objectives

- Gain an overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam.
- Understand the end-to-end Machine Learning capabilities of Amazon SageMaker.
- Deep dive into Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock (Foundation Models, Agents, Guardrails).
- Learn practical implementation through live demos of SageMaker Studio and Bedrock Chatbots.

### Speakers

- **AWS Solutions Architects Team** (Vietnam)

### Key Highlights

#### AWS AI/ML Services Overview (Amazon SageMaker)
- **End-to-end Platform:** SageMaker provides a unified interface for the entire ML lifecycle, from data preparation and labeling to model building, training, tuning, and deployment.
- **MLOps Integration:** Emphasized the importance of MLOps capabilities built into SageMaker to streamline operations and ensure model reproducibility.
- **SageMaker Studio:** A live walkthrough demonstrated how to manage ML workflows visually, making it accessible for both data scientists and developers.

#### Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
- **Foundation Models (FMs) Choice:** Comparison of different models available on Bedrock (Claude, Llama, Titan) and guidance on how to select the right model for specific use cases (speed vs. accuracy vs. cost).
- **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques to improve model output, including Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Few-shot learning.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Explained the architecture for connecting FMs to internal knowledge bases to reduce hallucinations and provide accurate, domain-specific answers.
- **Agents & Guardrails:** How to use Agents for multi-step tasks and Guardrails to ensure safety and content filtering.

### Key Takeaways

#### Simplification of ML Workflow
- **SageMaker** drastically reduces the operational overhead of managing ML infrastructure, allowing teams to focus on model logic rather than server maintenance.

#### Democratization of GenAI
- **Amazon Bedrock** offers a serverless experience to access top-tier Foundation Models via a single API, removing the need to manage heavy GPU infrastructure.
- **RAG is Essential:** For enterprise applications, RAG is the key pattern to make GenAI useful and reliable by grounding it in company data.

### Applying to Work

- **Explore SageMaker Canvas:** Try using SageMaker's low-code features for rapid prototyping of tabular data models.
- **Build a RAG Prototype:** Use Amazon Bedrock to build a simple Q&A bot connected to our internal documentation (e.g., internship guides or project specs).
- **Practice Prompt Engineering:** Apply "Chain-of-Thought" techniques to improve the quality of code generation or documentation tasks.

### Event Experience

The **"AI/ML/GenAI on AWS"** workshop was an intense and highly practical session.

#### Hands-on Focus
Unlike high-level seminars, this workshop focused heavily on **Live Demos**. Seeing a GenAI chatbot being built from scratch using Bedrock Agents gave me a concrete understanding of how the components (FMs, Knowledge Bases, Action Groups) fit together.

#### Comprehensive Toolset
I learned that AWS has a tool for every stage of the AI journey. Whether it's traditional ML (SageMaker) or cutting-edge GenAI (Bedrock), the ecosystem is highly integrated.

#### Networking
The morning "Ice-breaker" and networking session allowed me to connect with other developers and students interested in AI, giving me a broader perspective on how AI is being adopted in the Vietnam market.
