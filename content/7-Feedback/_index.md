> Below are my honest reflections after 12 weeks of internship. These opinions are based on my personal experience transitioning from academic knowledge to real-world corporate practice.

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**
The environment at FCJ is highly technical and fast-paced. Instead of "hand-holding," this environment pushes interns to be independent and proactive in their research. Initially, I felt a bit overwhelmed, but this professional pressure helped me adapt quickly to industry standards. This is a place for those who truly want to do "real work" rather than just observe.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**
The Mentors are quite strict but fair. When I encountered errors, instead of providing the solution immediately, the Mentor guided me on how to read logs and apply Root Cause Analysis. Although this approach takes time initially, it is extremely effective in honing a troubleshooting mindset. The Admin Team is very quick to offer support.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**
The gap between university theory and workplace reality is quite significant. While the university provides foundational programming thinking, this internship filled the gaps regarding **Infrastructure, Networking, and Deployment Strategies**. The tasks related to AWS Services and DevOps processes were entirely new and highly relevant to a Cloud Engineer career.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**
Beyond hard skills (AWS, Docker, IaC), the most valuable lesson I received was **"System Thinking."** I learned to view software not just as lines of code, but as a complete lifecycle from development and operation to monitoring. The weekly technical workshops (GenAI, Security) were high-quality value-adds that broadened my perspective.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**
The culture of "Knowledge Sharing" here is very strong. No question is considered "bad" if I have genuinely tried to research it beforehand. I appreciate the transparency in technical discussions, where even interns' opinions are listened to during architecture reviews.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**
The internship roadmap is structured methodically week-by-week. The internship is fair, with flexible working hours and fully equipped facilities.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**
The moment I successfully built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, deploying code to EC2 without manual intervention. That was the tangible result connecting all the disjointed concepts I had learned.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**
I suggest having more in-depth **Code Review** sessions specifically for interns. Sometimes my code "works," but I am not sure if it follows best practices or if it is optimized for cost/security. Receiving detailed feedback on code quality would help us improve faster.

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**
**Definitely yes.** However, I would clarify beforehand: I only recommend FCJ to friends who are truly proactive and highly disciplined. This is not a place for passive learners, but it is an excellent launchpad for those who are serious about becoming a Cloud Engineer.

### Suggestions & Expectations

* **Suggestion:** It would be great to have a "Mock Interview" session at the end of the internship to help us mentally prepare for applying for official jobs.
* **Expectation:** I hope to maintain a connection with the FCJ community.
* **Closing:** Thank you to the FCJ team for a challenging but very rewarding 3 months. The strict standards here have helped me become a better version of myself.
