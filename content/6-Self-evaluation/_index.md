During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** from **September 8th, 2025** to **November 28th, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

I actively participated in the **DevOps & Cloud Computing Roadmap**, through which I improved my skills in **AWS services (EC2, S3, VPC), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD pipelines, and Containerization**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency. However, I recognize that there is still significant room for improvement in my professional discipline and soft skills.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria (Self-rating: **6.5/10**):
